# Election_Analysis

Helping on the analysis of an audit election to determine the winner and the total results. 

## Overview of Election Audit

In this analysis we will review the audit of an election. With the help of Python, Visual Studio Code and other tools we were able to examine the total results in details of a data given with all the votes from the election. Within a matter of seconds with a finished code we are able to get the results from more than 300,000 lines of data. We could find how many number of votes of each county had, for each candidate, and define who the winner was within the total of votes. Within the making of the project we encountered with problems that made us try different alternatives to run a solution (code) and to understand better the language of Python. The data was given perfectly and we could manipulate them to find the beest solution.
